Stack used:

- NextJs

NextJs was the framework used to model components.
tRPC was used to build typeSafe apis.
Typescript was used as it is great.
Tailwind was used for styling components. It has many benefits over vanilla css.
Finally, prisma was used for database models and interacting with the database.
